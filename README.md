# Military-Aircraft-Detection

* The dataset comprises images for an aircraft image classification project, including seven distinct aircraft classes and a category representing bare land. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying images into one of the eight specified classes.
* The dataset consists of images belonging to the following eight classes:
* B2
* B52
* C135
* B1
* C130
* C17
* C5
* Badland (Empty Land)
The dataset includes a balanced distribution of images across the eight classes, ensuring representative samples for each aircraft type and the barren land category.

# Model Evalution
This case focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the accurate classification of military aircraft in satellite images. The primary objective is to develop a robust model capable of identifying and distinguishing various military aircraft types within the context of military bases. The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 98% on the training dataset and 93% on the validation/test dataset, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting military aircraft presence from satellite imagery.
